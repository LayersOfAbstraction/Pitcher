Pitcher is a simple application that will allow your team to operate more effectively in hunting down application bugs without resorting to spread sheets and emailing duplicate bug reports to each other. This application provides an effective login for your team to create users who can either function as administrators, who have their own jobs and job problems.

Standard users that the admin creates can create problems about the project that admin has assigned them to do. Each job can have it's own chat feature that allows users assigned to problem to clarify the problem's cause and what needs to be done.
