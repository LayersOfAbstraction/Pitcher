# My AWS SQL Server Container Hosting Strategy For 2023.

## Introduction 

I wanted to use the AWS Elastic Container Registry as I thought I could use my container from there during development in the cloud and deploy later.Strategy

I need to migrate AWS. Why? I want to get out of my apartment to use this container so I can develop on my MacBook Air by day and develop on my home computer in the evening or if it was raining. So I want to develop on more than one machine without having to have 2 different containers on two different computers makes sense?

I want to centralize development in one place. Currently the docker image containing the database sits on my home computer.

## Initializing development

Here's some advise the Bing AI gave me in terms of having a good developer workflow:

> 1. Hereâ€™s a simple workflow:
> 
> 2. Develop Locally: Develop your application on your MacBook Air and containerize it using Docker.
> 
> 3. Build Docker Image: Build a Docker image of your application.
> 
> 4. Push to Registry: AWS ECR, or any other Docker-compatible registry.

Here's the rest upon further prompting

> 5. Deploy on ECS: Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) to deploy your application from the Docker image stored in ECR in your environment.

So I realized I could have 2 images. One for development and one for production.

So in a nutshell the both the development and production workflows could look roughly something like this. 



## Persisting data to storage in AWS

You only need to then worry about how to manage the updated database schema changes pulled from ECS. Apparently
[this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65304031/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-download-a-file-out-of-an-ecs-container-to-local-mach)shows how we can do this in the AWS CLI.
